    <h2>Block Elements</h2>

    <p>Block elements are those that typically start on a new line and take up the full width <br> available. They create a
        "block" of content and stack on top of each other vertically. <br> They are used to structure the main layout of the
        page.  Common block elements include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> div: A generic container for grouping content.</li>
        <li> p: Defines a paragraph.</li>
        <li> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6: Define headings of different levels.</li>
        <li> ul, ol: Define unordered and ordered lists, respectively.</li>
        <li> li: Defines a list item within a list.</li>
        <li> header, footer, main, section, article, aside: Semantic elements for different sections of a page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>
        Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line. They only take up as much <br> width as necessary and
        flow along with the surrounding content. Inline elements are often <br> used to style or format parts of text within
        a block element. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>span: A generic inline container for styling or grouping small sections of text.</li>
        <li>a: Defines a hyperlink.</li>
        <li>strong: Makes text bold and indicates strong importance.</li>
        <li>em: Italicizes text and indicates emphasis.</li>
        <li>img: Embeds an image in the document.</li>
        <li>br: Inserts a line break within text.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Example:-</h3>
    <p>In this example, <br> The "div" elements are block-level, so they start on a new line and stretch to the width of the container. <br> The "span" element is inline, so it flows within the text and does not start on a new line.</p>
