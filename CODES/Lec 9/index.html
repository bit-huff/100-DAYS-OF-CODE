    <h2><b><u>HTML Id & Classes</u></b></h2>
    <h3>What is an ID?</h3>
    <p>An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations.</p>
    <div id="firstdiv" class="red green black">THIS IS MY FIRST DIV.</div>
    <span id="secondspan" class="red">THIS IS MY FIRST SPAN.</span>

    <h3>What are Classes?</h3>
    <p>The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.</p>
    <span class="red">THIS IS MY second SPAN.</span>
    <div class="red"> This is my second div but with same class of first div.</div>

    <h3>Differences Between IDs and Classes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uniqueness: IDs are unique, and classes can be reused.</li>
        <li>JavaScript: IDs are often used for JavaScript operations.</li>
        <li>Styling: Both can be used for styling, but IDs have higher specificity.</li>

    </ul>
